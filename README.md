Description

This is my personal project called Giggo. Giggo is a web-based application that assists its users to find part-time
professionals or individuals with certain specialties to help them. A user can post what is known as a "Gig", a short-term 
job that usually lasts few hours. Other users can see the "Gig" and apply for it. The user who posted the "Gig" can choose
from all the applicants who applied for the Gig, select one who seems most fit to fulfill the job, and contact the applicant.
After the service, both the user and the "Gigger", someone who helped the user with the task, can rate oneanother and write
short comments about oneanother. The application also allows the user to search "Gigs" by category and look for best "Gigger"
in that category of work. 

Giggo is for busy people who need quick help with certain tasks for small payment. 

The project was initiated fairly recently and is still in progress. Most of the backend is working; however, there is still
a lot to do.

The project utilizes PHP, MySQL, Javascript, Ajax, HTML, CSS.
